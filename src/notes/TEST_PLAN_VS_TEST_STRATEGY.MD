Hereâ€™s a detailed comparison of a **[Test Plan](TEST_PLAN.MD)** and a **[Test Strategy](TEST_STRATEGY.MD)** document:

| **Aspect**             | **Test Plan**                               | **Test Strategy**                             |
|------------------------|---------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| **Definition**          | A detailed document that outlines the scope, objectives, resources, and schedule of testing activities. | A high-level document that defines the testing approach and guidelines for all projects. |
| **Purpose**             | Describes how testing will be carried out for a specific project. | Provides a general testing approach applicable across multiple projects or the entire organization. |
| **Focus**               | Project-specific.                          | Organization or product line-specific.        |
| **Created by**          | Typically created by the Test Lead or QA Manager. | Created by QA Managers or Test Architects.    |
| **Content**             | Includes test scope, objectives, test criteria, environment, schedule, resources, risks, and deliverables. | Includes the testing objectives, tools, standards, processes, and metrics. |
| **Level of Detail**     | High level of detail, often updated frequently during the project. | High-level overview, typically static or updated infrequently. |
| **Example Sections**    | - Introduction<br> - Objectives<br> - Test Scope<br> - Test Items<br> - Test Environment<br> - Test Schedule<br> - Resource Allocation<br> - Risks and Mitigation | - Testing Objectives<br> - Testing Tools<br> - Standards & Guidelines<br> - Test Automation Strategy<br> - Defect Management Process<br> - Reporting Metrics |
| **Dynamic or Static**   | Dynamic, as it changes with project requirements. | Static, unless there are significant organizational changes. |
| **Use Case**            | Used during the execution phase of a project to guide specific testing activities. | Used for long-term planning and consistent testing practices across projects. |
| **Approval**            | Approved by Project Manager, QA Lead, or Stakeholders. | Approved by Senior Management or QA Directors. |

### Key Differences:
1. **Scope**:
    - **Test Plan** focuses on a particular project.
    - **Test Strategy** applies to the overall testing approach across the organization.

2. **Detail**:
    - **Test Plan** contains in-depth details specific to a project.
    - **Test Strategy** provides a broader overview with minimal details.

3. **Updates**:
    - **Test Plan** is updated as the project evolves.
    - **Test Strategy** remains static or changes infrequently.
